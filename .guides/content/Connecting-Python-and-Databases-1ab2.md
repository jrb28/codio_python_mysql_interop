# Python & MySQL

We have written Python programs in this program using both Jupyter and Spyder environments.  So far, we have inputted data into Python code from text files and from the Internet.  While it is possible for realistically-sized data sets to be streamed from the Internet, inputting data from text files is used much less often and is problematic with large-scale data sets.  Data is often loaded from databases whether they be a traditional relational database or newer database variants (e.g., data lakes, network DBs, schema-free MongoDB) and whether they be in the cloud, on your desktop, or on a company server.

The focus of this course content is to learn how to connect Python to a MySQL relational database and extract data from the database.  This same basic approach works for MySQL-compatible databases whether they be on your computer, on your company's server, or in the cloud.  Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have their own database applications that act just like MySQL databases and you can connect to them in exactly the same way we will by changing only the connection parameters to the database.  Different drivers/packages are needed for other database applications like SQL Server (Microsoft) and Postgres, for example, but the same basic approach we will use applies.
